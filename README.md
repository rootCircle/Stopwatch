# Stopwatch
A simple stopwatch implemented in Processing


## Introduction
Just a simple stopwatch,nothing else.

## About project
This project is a compilation of the few projects I made while stepping my foot in GUI programming 3~4 years back. Entire project is written in Processing JAVA.
One can find more info about that language [here](https://www.processing.org).

## How to Run
You will need a PDE to run this code and/or to compile it to distribute it. It is as simple installing Chrome after installing your Windows.
You can get PDE [here](https://www.processing.org/download).
